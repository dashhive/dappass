# Usage (in development)

Minimum setup:
At the top of your HTML file, within your `<head>` element:
```html
<script src="https://daypass.duckdns.org/dash-daypass.js"></script>
<script>
  DashDayPass.create({
    addresses: [
      "Xr55w6itzUwwQR3eAokwS7wAgqpsF5ACXi"
    ],
  });
</script>
```
At least one Dash Address is required.  See [the Dash documentation ](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/wallets/dashcore/send-receive.html) if you're unsure about how to get these.

You must also indicate to DashDayPass which parts of your page you want to protect.
You can:
  1. wrap the content in a `<dash-daypass-protect>` element:
  ```html
  ...page titles and unprotected content
    <dash-daypass-protect>
        ...protected content
    </dash-daypass-protect>
  ...more of my unprotected content
  ```
  1. add the `dash-daypass-protect` class to an existing element:
  ```html
  ...page titles and unprotected content
    <div class="dash-daypass-protect">
        ...protected content
    </div>
  ...more of my unprotected content
  ```
  1. pass a [CSS Selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) (such as `.my-protected-class`, `#my-protected-id`, or `my-html-tag`)to the DashDayPass.Create:
  ```html
  <html>
    <head>
      .....
      <script src="https://daypass.duckdns.org/dash-daypass.js"></script>
      <script>
        DashDayPass.create({
          addresses: [
            "Xr55w6itzUwwQR3eAokwS7wAgqpsF5ACXi"
          ],
          content: '.my-protected-class'
        });
      </script>
    </head>
    <body>
      ...page titles and unprotected content
      <div class="my-protected-class">
          ...protected content
      </div>
      ...more of my unprotected content
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

Optionally, you can define your own access plans.  DashDayPass comes with a default plan of Đ0.0001 for 24 hours access.  Defining your own plan(s) will replace the default plan.
The default is equivalent to:
```html
<script src="https://daypass.duckdns.org/dash-daypass.js"></script>
<script>
  DashDayPass.create({
    addresses: [
      "Xr55w6itzUwwQR3eAokwS7wAgqpsF5ACXi"
    ],
    plans: [
      {
        amount: 0.0001,
        duration: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
      },
    ],
  });
</script>
```
Define your own with: 
[example](https://daypass.duckdns.org/multi-plan.html)
```html
<script src="https://daypass.duckdns.org/dash-daypass.js"></script>
<script>
  DashDayPass.create({
    addresses: [
      "Xr55w6itzUwwQR3eAokwS7wAgqpsF5ACXi"
    ],
    plans: [
      {
        amount: 0.0001,
        duration: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
      },
      {
        amount: 0.0005,
        duration: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60,
      },
      {
        amount: 0.0010,
        duration: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60,
      },
    ],
  });
</script>
```

## NOTE:

#### In order to anonymously fingerprint a device, a slightly smaller amount than specified in the Plan is requested from your customer.  There are no charges for using this service (except the normal network fees.). Th amount you receive should be within 1% of the stated amount in the Plan.

Due to the limitations in the number of ecimal places ina  Dash transaction, there will also be some events where users are issued the same fingerprint amount as someone who has already paid within the last 10 minutes, so they may gain access to your content for free, around 1% of the time.  Each new address you add to the "addresses" field reduces the chance of this happening, so add a few!
